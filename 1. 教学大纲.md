## UK Music Grade System

Students starting a music degree in the UK are expected to be at grade 8 minimum in their instrument and at least grade 5 in music theory. Beyond grade 8, music exams can be taken at diploma level - there are 3 levels post grade 8, roughly equivalent to undergraduate 1st year, Bachelors and Masters degrees.

## What ABRSM/Trinity Music Theory Grade are You?

https://www.mymusictheory.com/for-students/quizzes/388-what-music-theory-grade-are-you

- There are 8 grades (followed by diplomas from Trinity but not ABRSM).
- Grade 1 is elementary level and starts with basic notation, keys with 1 sharp/flat in the key signature, three different time signatures, and the treble and bass clefs.
- Each subsequent grade is slightly more complex with added keys, foreign terms, time signatures, musical symbols, chords and intervals.
- Grade 5 is the required level for anyone who wants to take an ABRSM practical exam at grade 6 or higher (some alternative exams are allowed - see the ABRSM website for details). Grade 5 Trinity is also accepted by the ABRSM as a pre-requisite.
- Grades 6-8 take an in depth look at harmony, figured bass (ABRSM only) and compositional techniques. A pass or higher at these grades gives you credit in the form of UCAS points. Grade 8 is roughly the same level as an undergraduate first year music degree.

## Grades 1-5 vs. Grades 6-8

There is a big difference in the **type** of content in the earlier music theory grade exams, compared to the higher three levels.

Grades 1-5 basically require you to learn musical **facts**, and then give those facts as answers. A "fact" might be a particular scale, or what an ornament is, or what a key signature stands for, for example.

In grades 6-8, 50% of the exam is **skills-based**, and your answers will be creative. You will need to **write music** - harmony, or melody, or both. (Grades 1-5 used to include a skills-based composition question, but the ABRSM sadly removed this in 2018). For most students, the gap between grades 5 and 6 is very large, because learning **skills** tends to be more difficult than just learning **facts**. For this reason, you should not assume that you will sail through ABRSM grade 6 theory quickly, if you found the earlier grades quite easy - they are a different kind of exam.

* 听力与扒带：虽然当前AI扒带准确度很高，但听力训练，更多的是为了培养乐感，不断的扒带，是升级自己的编曲作品到出版级的必经之路。
* 乐理与和弦部分：重要的是理解在基础和弦进行之上进行“和弦替换”的思路，并掌握自己熟悉的、灵活的和弦编配方法，进而达到即兴伴奏的水平。 
* 配器与乐器演奏：最重要的是熟悉一件和弦乐器，并且从四大件的标准写法开始，不断扩展高级的用法，以及高级的乐器。 
* 歌曲设计：从最开始，“机械化”地设计编曲的段落，到增加艺术化的表达，将编曲作为服务音乐情绪的工具。 
* 软硬件：是编曲的工具，虽然编曲初期仅仅需要一个电脑，甚至不需要其他硬件，但随着编曲学习深入，硬件设备、软音源，以及混音的技巧是必不可缺的。
